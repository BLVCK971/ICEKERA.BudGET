# Requirements Prequisite

Requirements describe in detail what a software system is supposed to do.

Synonyms : Specification, Functional spec, 

## Why ?
- Ensure that the user rather than the programmer drives the system's functionality. The user can review them and agree to them. keep you from guessing what the user wants.
- Avoid arguments between programmer. You can resolve disagreement by looking at them.
- Minimizes changes during developement.
- Key to project success. More important than construction techniques.

## Handling requirements changes :

### Use the requirements checklist list at the en of the section to assess the quality of your requirements
If the requirements aren't good enought,stop work, back up, and make them right before you proceed.

### Make sure everyone knows the cost of requirements changes.
Since it's not in the requirements document, revise with client schedule and cost estimate so you (or the client) can decide whether you want to do it now or later. Many "must haves" will quickly turn into "nice to haves".

### If needed, Set-up a change-control procedure

### If needed, Use development approaches that accomodate changes
Build a little, get a little feed back from your users, adjust your design a little, make a few changes, and build a little more. The key is using short development cycles so that you can respond to you users quickly. 

### Keep your eyes on Business Case for the project
Refer back to business reason for doing the projet on each feature. Evaluate the business value of ideas.
